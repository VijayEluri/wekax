Introduction to Classification Package

1, how to use ID3 Decision Tree?

first, suppose you get a file as input data,and the path is /home/xxx/data. And the content is as follows:
===========================================================
Age, Education, Income, Marital Status, Purchase?
36 - 55, masters, high, single, will buy
18 - 35, high school, low, single, won't buy
36 - 55, masters, low, single, will buy
18 - 35, bachelors, high, single, won't buy
< 18, high school, low, single, will buy
18 - 35, bachelors, high, married, won't buy
36 - 55, bachelors, low, married, won't buy
> 55, bachelors, high, single, will buy
36 - 55, masters, low, married, won't buy
> 55, masters, low, married, will buy
36 - 55, masters, high, single, will buy
> 55, masters, high, single, will buy
< 18, high school, high, single, won't buy
36 - 55, masters, low, single, will buy
36 - 55, high school, low, single, will buy
< 18, high school, low, married, will buy
18 - 35, bachelors, high, married, won't buy
> 55, high school, high, married, will buy
> 55, bachelors, low, single, will buy
36 - 55, high school, high, married, won't buy
===========================================================

then, here is an example:
===========================================================
from  wekax.classification import *

ID3=ID3()
ID3.load("/home/xxx/data")
print ID3.data
ID3.buildDecisionTree()
===========================================================
