Introduction to Apriori

first, suppose we have a test.dat file under your wekax directory. The content should be:
A,B,C,D
B,C,E
A,B,C,E
B,D,E
A,B,C,D

second, suppose we have a test.py file under your wekax directory. The content should be:
from wekax.core import Transactions,Transaction
from wekax.association import Apriori

class mytrans(Transaction):
    split=","
trans=Transactions(type=mytrans)
trans.load(file("test.dat"))
for i in trans:
    for j in i:
        print j
assoc=Apriori(trans,2)
print assoc.split
assoc.buildAssociation()

then:
# cd [your wekax dir]
# python test.py
