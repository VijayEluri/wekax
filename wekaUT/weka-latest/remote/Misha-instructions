Subject: Re: Distributed experiments

Sugato, here are the steps; the original email to Prem was incomplete:

1.  Take remote.policy and remoteEngine.jar from /u/mbilenko/weka/remote
2.  Modify paths in remote.policy; see /u/mbilenko/remote/remote.policy
for example.
3.  Take DatabaseUtils.props from /u/mbilenko, put in your home directory;
modify so that it writes into your mySQL database.
4.  Run "rmic weka.experiment.RemoteEngine" to generate stub and skeleton
files in your weka tree.
5.  Run the clients: use  /u/mbilenko/weka/remote/runClient script; modify
for your own paths.

Important things:

- remember to repackage weka.jar and restart the clients when you make any
changes to classes.
- remember to write to the database.

That should be about it, let me know if something doesn't work!
